BUAS Intake Assignment - Greedy Astronaut by Bram van Dijke

The game is about a spaceman in a spaceship that is trying to collect as much treasure as the spaceman 
possibly can before the timer runs out. The spaceman needs to navigate itself throughout space to collect the treasure by colliding 
with it. At the end of the 60 seconds, you can see your score and high-score. Try and beat your high-score! If something is unclear, 
in the game there is a screen named "How to play".

The controls:
[W] - move up
[A] - move left
[S] - move down
[D] - move right
